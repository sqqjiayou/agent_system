After the Chinese government listed it as a “strategic emerging industry” in December last year, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu pledged in his annual policy address last month to develop the sector in “a wide array of application scenarios”, including rescue, surveying, goods delivery and passenger travel.A Meituan drone landing on an express delivery station in Shenzhen.

It takes an average of 15 to 20 minutes for drones to deliver a meal, about half the time needed for manual deliveries, the public affairs head of Meituan’s drone division Yan Yan told local newspaper Hong Kong Commercial Daily.AdvertisementAdvertisement",
