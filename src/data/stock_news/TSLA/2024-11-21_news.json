In discussing the Company’s results, Joseph C. Bartolacci, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Our consolidated operating results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter reflected another quarter of solid performance by our core businesses and, consistent with prior quarters, was impacted by continuing customer delays in our energy business. Our previously announced cost reduction program is now underway, as evidenced by the charges reflected in our GAAP results this quarter, and progressing well. Overall, we were pleased with the consolidated operating results as we again demonstrated the resilience of Matthews and our employees in mitigating the challenges faced by one of our segments. For the year ended September 30, 2024, consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $205.2 million. “The Memorialization segment reported higher adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter despite lower unit volumes, which were related to a decline in U.S. deaths compared to a year ago. Ongoing cost control efforts combined with improved price realization were the key drivers in the improvement in operating margins. This segment has done a tremendous job of maintaining its level of performance over the past several years despite the declines in unit volume following the pandemic. “We are also pleased to report that our SGK Brand Solutions segment reported another consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. This segment has stabilized nicely over the last two years with modest improvements in margins and is continuing its recovery following the global impacts of the pandemic and the European impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. Sales for the segment increased compared to a year ago primarily reflecting improved pricing to mitigate inflationary cost increases, higher sales for the merchandising and private label businesses, and growth in the Asia-Pacific market. “Sales for the Industrial Technologies segment for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter declined from a year ago primarily resulting from further customer delays in our energy business. The current quarter also reflected a continued soft warehouse automation market; however, order rates have been improving recently which could bode well for a good recovery next fiscal year. “With respect to our cost reduction program, current quarter charges include non-cash goodwill impairment and other asset write-downs primarily in connection with our European operations, in addition to severance and other costs. The program is also targeting general and administrative cost reductions. For our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, we reported another quarter of lower corporate and non-operating costs compared to a year ago. For the year, corporate and non-operating costs were approximately 5% lower than last year. “During the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, we reduced our outstanding debt by $53.8 million. In addition, we completed the refinancing of outstanding senior notes due December 1, 2025. Due to current interest rates and the ongoing strategic review of our business portfolio, we opted for a shorter-term bond (three-year maturity) with an ability to call in one year. We are projecting higher operating cash flow next year as our working capital investments in fiscal 2024 begin to convert to operating cash flow, which will be partially mitigated by costs in connection with our cost reduction program. “Looking forward to fiscal 2025, we continue to face the uncertainty of project timing in our Industrial Technologies segment, specifically relating to our energy business. While we currently expect deliveries to be substantially completed during the year, quarterly timing is still difficult to forecast. Our cost reduction programs should mitigate some of this impact. “We expect another solid performance for our Memorialization business in fiscal 2025 as U.S. deaths appear to have generally normalized following COVID and we are projecting continued growth in our cremation-related products sales. Continued growth is also projected for our SGK Brand Solutions segment reflecting ongoing improvement in U.S. market conditions, more stable conditions in Europe, and further growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
